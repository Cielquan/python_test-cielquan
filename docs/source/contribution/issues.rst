Contribution through Github Issues
==================================

This section will guide you through the process of contributing through
:repo:`Github Issues <issues>`.
Use your best judgment to follow the guidelines below. Basic rule of thump is the more
information the better.

.. note::
    Please check the :repo:`Github issue tracker <issues>` prior submitting any issue to
    avoid multiple instances of the same issue.

    If you find a *closed* issue covering your topic and you think that the
    issue is not fully solved/covered yet, please open a new issue and reference the
    closed one.

You may also consider using :repo:`Github Discussions <discussions>` instead if
appropriate.

If your issue does not fall in one of the below categories use the formless
``Something Else`` category:

    - `Bug reports`_
    - `Suggestion for improvements`_
    - `Documentation changes`_


Bug reports
-----------

This section will guide you through the process of submitting a bug report which helps
others to understand your report, reproduce the problem and eventually find related
issues.

Bugs are tracked at the aforementioned :repo:`Github issue tracker <issues>` where you
can create your issue and with the ``Bug Report`` option. Through the option your
issue's body is automatically filled with the
:repo:`Bug Report template <blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/.bug-report.md>`.
By filling this template you make it easier for others to understand the issue and help
you with or fix the problem.

Explain your topic as detailed as possible to help others reproduce the problem:

- The more details the better.
- Use a clear, concise and descriptive title.
- Describe the exact steps to take to reproduce the problem.
- Describe the behavior you observed following the steps above.
- Describe the behavior you expected instead while following the steps above.

If you have specific examples to reproduce the problem like config/code snippets, files
or links to a Github project please include them or make a
`Gist <https://gist.github.com/>`__ and include its link.

.. CHANGE ME: include if programm has CLI

.. If the problem is an error which unexpectedly occurs, please run the same command again
.. with the ``--debug`` option to get a more information and add this information also.

You can also provide more context by asking yourself these questions:

- Did the problem just start happening recently after an update or something?
- If so can you reproduce the problem with older versions?
- Does the problem occur with older or new python versions also?
- Does the problem occur every time and is reliably reproducible?
- If not how often does it occur? Please provide as many details as possible.

The template also asks for some info about your environment:

- What **version** of ``python_test-cielquan`` do you use?
- Which **OS** are you using and which **version**?
- Which **python version** are you using?


Suggestion for improvements
---------------------------

This section will guide you through the process of submitting a feature request
which helps others to understand your suggestion and eventually find related issues.
You can suggest enhancements to existing functionality or completely new features.
Your ideas are welcome!

Feature requests are tracked at the aforementioned :repo:`Github issue tracker <issues>`
where you can create your issue and choose the ``Feature Request`` option. Through the
option your issue's body is automatically filled with the
:repo:`Feature Request template <blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/.feature-request.md>`.
By filling this template you make it easier for others to understand your suggestions.

Explain your topic as detailed as possible to help others understand your ideas:

- The more details the better.
- Use a clear, concise and descriptive title.
- What behavior do you want to be changed?
- How is the behavior currently?
- How do you want it do be changed and why?
- What new feature to do want to be added and why?
- How should it work and why should it work this way?

Maybe you have an idea how your request can be implemented. If so please describe it as
detailed as possible. Maybe even with code snippets. You can include them directly or
make a `Gist <https://gist.github.com/>`__ and include its link.


Documentation changes
---------------------

If you have errors or enhancement ideas for the documentation please follow the steps
above accordingly but use the ``Documentation`` issue option to get the
:repo:`Documentation template <blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/.documentation.md>`.
